# stockviewer

This is a sample app for testing out the following frameworks and whatever fits my fancy: 
- Gradle
- Dropwizard
- JDBI
- Postgres
- Mockito
- Flyway
- JOOQ

The goal here is to put together a bare minimum sample necessary to get each thing to work. It will probably be annotated with gotchas, weirdness, and whatever is useful as a minimum working example.
